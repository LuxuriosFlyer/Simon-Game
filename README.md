# Simon-Game

This is a digital implementation of the classic Simon game, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Simon is a memory game where players must replicate a sequence of lights and sounds generated by the game. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging.

# Technologies Used
HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
CSS: Styling language used for enhancing the visual presentation.
JavaScript: Programming language used for implementing game logic and interactivity.
jQuery: JavaScript library used for simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.

# Credits
This project is inspired by the original Simon game invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison.
